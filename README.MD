# Marble-AI Assignment

## Description

The application utilizes several npm packages for UI components, data visualization, and state management. It includes features such as loading skeletons for displaying loading states, line charts for visualizing data, custom date-picker integration with LineChart, mouse-over events for displaying pop-ups, and accordions for toggling the visibility of components.
